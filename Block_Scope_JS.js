    /* Block means enclosed within the curly brackets('{}'). 
    And the scope means the accessible of the variable. 
    Now the accessibel happens in two places i.e. one at the 1.Global area 
    2. Block area.
    In global area the variable is accessible globally whereas in local variable accessible
    is only within the block . "let" and const have block accessible 
    whereas var is globally accessible.
